# POAP-2021-retire-CUT
My submission for Event For Release Of The CUT Self-Retire App. My design depicts the Metamask fox cutting a green, sustainable path through a densely polluted fog. Indidivuals that use the CUT self-retire app are similarly forging this path. Thank you for your consideration, and good luck to CUT on the feature release!!
